    <h2 data-i18n="index-h2-whatis">What is LeftValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-answer">LeftValues is a leftist quiz inspired by and based upon the <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position on the left-wing spectrum. If you are not a leftist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you.
        You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. The questions for each axes are presented
        in order, rather than scattered. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br /> There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b>        questions in the test.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="index-h2-whatvalues">What are the values?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-sixaxes">There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-rev-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#890000;">Revolution</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FC5959;">Reform</b><br/> Those with a higher revolution score tend to support a radical and rapid overthrow of the capitalist system through a mass uprising. Those with a higher
        reform score tend to favor inducing gradual changes within capitalist structures, such as liberal democracy, with the eventual goal of reaching socialism.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-sci-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#88232B;">Scientific</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F0037;">Utopian</b><br/> Those with a higher scientific score tend to support or sympathize with the Marxist analysis of society along the lines of dialectical materialism. Those
        with a higher utopian score tend to believe in a more idealistic analysis of society and reject materialist approaches.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-cent-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#560000;">Central</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#000000;">Decentral</b><br/> Those with a higher central score tend to support an economic structure based around centralized national planning. Those with a higher decentral score tend
        to support an economic structure based around decentralized planning, usually on a more localized scale.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-int-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#782F52;">International</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F3300;">National</b><br/> Those with a higher international score tend to support forming an international socialist movement, often with the eventual goal of abolishing nations.
        Those with a higher national score tend to prioritize building socialism within existing borders and reject the goal of a world socialist republic.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-party-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#963B33;">Party</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F333B;">Union</b><br/> Those with a higher party score tend to favor using political parties as the basis of a socialist movement. Those with a higher union score tend to favor using
        trade unions and other forms of mass organization as a basis of a socialist movement. Being pro-party does not necessarily mean you oppose unions and vice versa, it is more about preference.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-prod-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#804E00;">Production</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#586808;">Nature</b><br/> Those with a higher production score tend to prioritize industrial output and self-sustainability over ecological goals. Those with a higher nature score
        tend to support an environmentally oriented economy with strict ecological protections.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index-cons-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#27577A;">Conservative</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#C4A717;">Progressive</b><br/> Those with a higher conservative score tend to favor more socially conservative policies and views. Those with a higher progressive score tend to
        support more socially progressive policies and views.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index-h2-closest">What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-similar">Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific leftist ideology. There are currently twelve possible ideologies, with more to come in the future. This is a work in progress and may not work as intended. Suggestions are very
        welcome. The current ideologies are: Marxism-Leninism, Orthodox Marxism, Eco-Marxism, Centrist Marxism, Council Communism, Left Communism, Anarcho-Communism, Eco-Anarchism, Market Anarchism, Utopian Socialism, Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index-h2-scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/6WZYMb5GXkkDLhxr5">short form</a>        or open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/LeftValues/leftvalues.github.io">GitHub Page</a>.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index-h2-tracked">Am I being tracked?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-tracked">LeftValues does utilize very basic tracking to get an idea of the amount of visitors. No personal information is collected and answers/results are not saved. If you do not believe me, the code is open source and available for all to see. For transparency
        purposes, the collected data for the first week since release can be viewed on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcnZdMkEmGXgLMS8izvqd_JEcgjuFgUnfqCRO32q2go/edit?usp=sharing">Google Document</a>.</p>
